# Arcanoid-game

This is one of the console games I've created folliwing the instructions on https://javarush.ru/quests. It helped me to better understand the concepts of OOP in Java and the way the created objects should coopeate with each other. It also gave me some basic knowledge of Swing and practical skills of how to use.

(Arcanoid is the main class of this program)
